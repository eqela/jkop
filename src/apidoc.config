= Welcome to the Jkop API reference =

Jkop is a comprehensive, general-purpose class library for software development, which can be used to
develop many kinds of software applications on multiple platforms, programming languages and operating
systems. Jkop provides a collection of libraries for several different purposes, and the developers can
choose which libraries to use for a particular kind of project.

= Further information =

In addition to this API documentation, the Eqela development community, EQDN ([http://eqdn.tech]), provides
many other documents, tutorials and references for Jkop and allows developers interact, collaborate and ask
questions:
