** The implementation of this is system dependent, and depending on the actual
** environment, the object that implements ApplicationContext may also implement
** other interfaces that provide additional features into that particular environment.
**

interface is LoggingContext:

**
** Returns a File object that represents a directory where this application can store
** private data. The data is specific to the current applications and (if applicable)
** the current user. The exact location and implementation fully depends on the
** underlying operating system.
